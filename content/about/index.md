Broadly, my program of research addresses how stressors influence organismal physiology and behavior.

Here. The study of stress spans levels of organization, from cells to ecosystems, and encompasses multiple fields of science, including (behavioral) endocrinology, cell biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, medicine, and psychology. In the quest to categorize the importance of stress in organismal functioning, multiple fields have provided their own perspectives and interpretations of data. As a result, this area of study has literally hundreds of hypotheses on how stress impacts life, but we still have many unanswered, fundamental questions. For example, What is stress, exactly? How do we measure it and what, operationally, is a stress phenotype? What is a “good” stress response? Is it adaptive? These questions exist due to the complex nature of the stress concept and the multiple lenses and perspectives through which we, as scientists, address it. Robust probing of assumptions and stress hypotheses are necessary, as without a more comprehensive understanding of a) what stress is, b) how we operationalize this construct, and c) how to categorize a stress phenotype, we cannot probe fully comparative and in-depth studies of this phenomenon, nor can we make predictions about which organisms (or populations) will be most susceptible or resistant to future challenges (e.g., climate change). Thus, my lab addresses fundamental questions, probes assumptions, and aids in understanding the mechanisms involved in how organisms evolve and respond to dynamic and/or stressful environments.

Thus far, much of our lab work has focused on the behavioral, physiological, and fitness implications of plasticity in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and associated physiological systems to address both basic and applied research questions. The HPA axis is evolutionarily conserved, and its hormones are critical for survival. These hormones (e.g., cortisol, corticosterone, corticotropin-releasing factor) play vital roles in many physiological and behavioral processes, and influence reproduction, immune system regulation, memory and cognition, emotional processing, feeding, and cardiovascular function. Many human diseases and psychopathologies (e.g., PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease) present with HPA axis dysregulation for unknown reasons and by unknown mechanisms. Using animal and human studies, we work to understand how stressor-related responses, at various biological levels of analysis, correspond to differences in health, behavior, and evolutionary fitness. We do this by tackling **two complementary central questions**:

    1.	How does response to and recovery from stressors translate into functional consequences for organismal behavior (e.g., cognition, risk-taking, feeding), life history trade-offs, health, and evolutionary fitness?
    
   2.	How do individual variation (e.g., sensory perception, genotype, diet, sex, life history stage), and interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment alter physiological and behavioral responses to stressors?
    
Both questions are important for understanding animal life histories, ecological interactions, and evolutionary trade-offs, and are also relevant to human health and disease.

Relatedly, we also probe the ecology (contexts, environment, interactions) and evolution (change over time and space) in the stress concept. That is how does the way in which we (researchers) view, interpret, and analyze data impact our findings? What do the lenses I use to view my data mean about what I will find? How does individual lab context, experimental design, field norms and analysis impact our understanding of stress? How did knowledge and application of the stress concept change over time? As scientists, our training, specialized niches, fields of study, places of work, routes of funding, positionality in society, and time in history all impact the way in which we ask questions, design studies, and interpret data. Given these realities, as we build and expand the field, it is imperative that we always probe assumptions and critically dissect our data and interpretations. As we know from organismal data, perceptions of (challenging) events can alter outcomes. Not only is perception key for the organism responding to challenges but it is also critical for the ones studying the response – that is the way in which experiments are designed, dependent variables are chosen, data are analyzed and interpreted, and how information is contextualized in our broader literature. We use the below framework to probe these questions.
