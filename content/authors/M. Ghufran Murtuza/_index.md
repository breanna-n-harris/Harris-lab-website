I am from Coppell, Texas. I am a member of the TTU Honors College with a major in Microbiology and minors in Chemistry, Spanish, and Health Professions. I joined the lab in Fall, 2021 and fell in love with research in the biological sciences. I am also involved in research organizations such as the TrUE Scholars and CISER. My plans after graduation are to go to medical school to become a physician focused on primary care, serving my community, and furthering the field of science. 

Ghufran graduated from TTU with Highest Honors in May 2025. He went on to medical school at Baylor College of Medicine.
