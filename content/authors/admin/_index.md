I earned my Ph.D. in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology from the University of California, Riverside in 2012. After graduation I spent a year at the Claremont Colleges as a Visiting Assistant Professor teaching Introductory Biology Lab and Vertebrate Physiology. In 2013, I joined the Department of Biological Sciences at TTU, first as a postdoc and then as a Research Assistant Professor. I was promoted to Research Associated Professor and 2022 is her first year as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Biological Sciences. As a Behavioral Endocrinologist, my research addresses how stressors influence organismal physiology, behavior, and life-history tradeoffs in vertebrate species. I am a passionate educator and a member of the TTU Teaching Academy. I take an organismal approach to research (e.g., what are the functional, organism-level consequences of physiological responses?) and my work is integrative, comparative, collaborative, and interdisciplinary. Students play a  major role in my lab and over 40 students have been part of the team. My lab has been funded by both the NSF and NIH and by foundational and internal grant monies.
