Hello! My name is Angela Nunez and I am from Plano, Texas. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Biology with a minor in Chemistry and starting my third year at TTU. I joined the lab in the Spring 2024 semester, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed and learned a lot so far. In addition to being involved in this lab, I am also an ambassador for the College of Arts & Sciences. After graduation, I plan to go to PA school.
