Hi there! My name is Gabby Aguilar, and I’m from Hobbs, New Mexico. I attended the New Mexico Junior College as part of the early college program, where I earned my Associates in Science and Associates in Arts. Currently, I’m in my second year at Texas Tech University, majoring in Biology with minors in Dance, Chemistry, and Health Professions. In the spring of 2024, I joined the Harris Lab and have thoroughly enjoyed both learning and conducting research on Stress and Endocrinology. After graduation, I plan on attending medical school to become a physician specializing in surgery and doing research to contribute to advancements within the medical field.
