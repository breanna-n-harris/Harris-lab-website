Here we determined if behavior and both baseline and post-stressor corticosterone change during aging in the APPswePS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease

* Consistent with glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis, baseline cort increased with age.

* Overall, tg mice had higher post-stressor, but not baseline, cort than non-tg mice.

* Across genotypes, females had higher (baseline and post-stressor) cort than males.

* Tg females had higher AÎ² and showed more anxiety-like behavior than tg males.

* No robust correlations, suggesting outcomes are not related on the individual level.

* Despite robust accumulaiton of amyloid beta in the hippocampus and cortex, male and female APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice do not differ robustly from their non-transgenic littermates in physiological, endocrine, and behavioral measures at the range of ages studied here.
