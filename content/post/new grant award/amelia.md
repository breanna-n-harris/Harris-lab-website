Collaborative project, led by Dr. Amelia Talley of Psychological Sciences, to establish causal support for the role of internalized stress, pertaining to identity uncertainty in contributing to drinking beahvior. 

With our team of researchers (Talley, Harris, Hohman, Littlefield) we will determine if physiological stress responses, whether driven by the pharmacological effects of
