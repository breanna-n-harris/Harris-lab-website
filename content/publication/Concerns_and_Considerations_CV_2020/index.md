abstract: As increasing evidence emerges concerning the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on women academics (1, 2), we hope our work continues to prompt institutions and departments to advance gender equity in tenure and promotion (3). For example, Arora et al.(4) have developed a department-specific rubric to assess COVID-19â€™s impact on a case-by-case basis. This rubric is in the form of a curriculum vitae (CV) addendum matrix, which notes COVID-19 related challenges and contributions. They also encourage adding caregiving responsibilities to the matrix.
