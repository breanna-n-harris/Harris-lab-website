abstract: "Trade-offs resulting from the high demand of offspring production are a central focus of many subdisciplines within the field of biology. Yet, despite the historical and current interest on this topic, large gaps in our understanding of whole-organism trade-offs that occur in reproducing individuals remain, particularly as it relates to the nuances associated with female reproduction. This volume of Integrative and Comparative Biology (ICB) contains a series of papers that focus on reviewing trade-offs from the female-centered perspective of biology (i.e., a perspective that places female reproductive biology at the center of the topic being investigated or discussed). These papers represent some of the work showcased during our symposium held at the 2024 meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) in Seattle, Washington. In this roundtable discussion, we use a question-and-answer format to capture the diverse perspectives and voices involved in our symposium. We hope that the dialogue featured in this discussion will be used to motivate researchers interested in understanding trade-offs in reproducing females and provide guidance on future research endeavors."
