abstract: "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is specified by amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neuroinflammation. Obesity, marked by excessive white adipose tissue (WAT), leads to metabolic dysfunctions, systemic inflammation and enhances risk for AD. We previously reported that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, improved metabolic profiles and reduced serum amyloid β (Aβ40) in diet-induced obese transgenic (TG) amyloidogenic AD mice. Here, we studied the links among obesity, WAT inflammation and neuroinflammation in this AD model."
