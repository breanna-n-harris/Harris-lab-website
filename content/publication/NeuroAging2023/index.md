abstract: Preclinical models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related cognitive decline can be useful for developing therapeutics. The current study longitudinally assessed short-term memory, using a delayed matching-to-position (DMTP) task, and attention, using a 3-choice serial reaction time (3CSRT) task, from approximately 18 weeks of age through death or 72 weeks of age in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, a widely used mouse model of AD-related amyloidosis. Both transgenic (Tg) and non-Tg mice exhibited improvements in DMTP accuracy over time. Breaks in testing reduced DMTP accuracy but accuracy values quickly recovered in both Tg and non-Tg mice. Both Tg and non-Tg mice exhibited high accuracy in the 3CSRT task with breaks in testing briefly reducing accuracy values equivalently in the 2 genotypes. The current results raise the possibility that deficits in Tg APPswe/PS1dE9 mice involve impairments in learning rather than declines in established performances. A better understanding of the factors that determine whether deficits develop will be useful for designing evaluations of potential pharmacotherapeutics and may reveal interventions for clinical application.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In summary, the current longitudinal study of cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice found little evidence for age-related declines in short-term memory (DMTP) or attention (3CSRT) in non-Tg or Tg mice, despite the buildup of Aβ in the brains of the Tg mice. Consideration of the literature on cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice suggests that the absence of deficits in the current study is not attributable to an absence of stress or to the use of food restriction. Whether and at what level of intensity repeated testing attenuates deficit development might be interesting for future investigations to understand the mechanisms of potential beneficial effects of repeated testing. Finally, the absence of deficits in APP/PS1 Tg mice in the current study indicates that the combination of procedures and testing regimens studied here cannot, unfortunately, be utilized in APP/PS1 mice to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions for cognitive decline.
