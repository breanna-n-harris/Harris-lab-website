abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. Systemic inflammation and obesity may exacerbate AD pathogenesis. We previously reported anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effects of EPA in mice. We aimed to determine whether EPA reduces obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions and Aβ accumulation in AD amyloidogenic mice.
